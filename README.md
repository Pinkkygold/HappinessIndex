## ☁️ Deployment on Render

### 1. Create `render.yaml`

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: happiness-predictor
    env: python
    buildCommand: ""
    startCommand: gunicorn app:app
    plan: free
    region: oregon
```

### 2. Create a GitHub Repository

* Push your local project to GitHub.

### 3. Deploy to Render

* Go to [https://render.com](https://render.com)
* Click "New Web Service"
* Connect your GitHub repo
* Fill in the details:

  * **Start command**: `gunicorn app:app`
  * **Environment**: Python
  * **Build command**: (optional) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
